### Hi there, I'm Amanda ðŸ‘‹

Currently, Iâ€™m a research technician in a life sciences laboratory. My programming journey began with writing simple R scripts to graph ecological data. Ever since Iâ€™ve had a major soft spot for data visualization, often finding ways to work analysis projects into my private life.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently picking up python with [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/)

ðŸ’ª Iâ€™ve completed the web development foundations track with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
